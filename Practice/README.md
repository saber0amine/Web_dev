HTML and CSS Practice Directory
This directory contains the files that I created while practicing HTML and CSS. The purpose of this directory is to showcase my skills and progress as I learn and improve my knowledge of web development.

Files
The following files are included in this directory:

index.html: This is the main HTML file for the project. It contains the structure and content of the web page.

style.css: This is the CSS file that styles the HTML content. It contains the layout, typography, and colors for the web page.

images/: This directory contains all the images used in the project.

Usage
To view the web page, open the index.html file in a web browser. The page should display with the styles applied from the style.css file.

To make changes to the HTML or CSS, open the respective file in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom. Save the changes and refresh the web page in the browser to see the updates.

Credits
The design and content of this project are original and created by me. However, I did use external resources to learn and improve my skills. These resources include online tutorials, documentation, and forums such as Stack Overflow.
